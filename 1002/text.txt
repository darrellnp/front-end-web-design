Yes, I have downloaded photo and video editing apps such as CapCut and iMovie for mobile. During high school, I utilized iMovie to edit various school projects. I arranged video clips, incorporated sound effects, and added transitions to enhance the videos. Recently, I've been using CapCut for editing my personal videos on TikTok.


In the process of crafting my personal website, I included sections dedicated to showcasing my portfolio, projects, and ways to contact me. However, a hiccup emerged when visitors attempted to reach out via the contact formâ€”I realized that messages weren't making their way to my inbox. After diligent troubleshooting, I unearthed a solution by stumbling upon and implementing specific code snippets sourced from the internet. By integrating these fixes into my website's code, I successfully resolved the issue with the contact form. Now, I can confidently say that messages sent through the form are reliably reaching me, ensuring a smoother and more effective means of communication with visitors to my site.
